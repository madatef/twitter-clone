# twitter-clone
This is a clone of twitter where you can sign up, login, create and interact with posts.

# Notes
1. The app doesn't support messaging.
2. The app might crash at any point where the database and/or cloud are overloaded, since cloudinary and MongoDB free quotas allow only a few hundreds MBs of space.
3. There are bugs in the UI (retweet counter) that arise upon users retweeting a retweet and further that I couldn't care less to fix ðŸ˜† as the logic for this is too effortful for a demo project
4. The app doesn't also support realtime notifications and websockets bacuse I got too lazy coming this far in the project.
